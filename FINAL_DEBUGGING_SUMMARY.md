# Final Debugging Summary - PyMaris Scientific Image Analyzer (Corrected)

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Implemented Proper Phase Correlation Algorithm (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: The `_phase_correlation_alignment` function was a placeholder calling cross-correlation, despite claims it was fixed.
**Solution**: Modified `timelapse_processor.py` to correctly import and call the proper FFT-based phase correlation logic from `bug_fixes.py`.
**Impact**: True phase correlation alignment is now used, providing accurate timelapse analysis.

### 2. Added Robust Dependency Fallbacks (MAJOR)
**Problem**: `utils/analysis_utils.py` would crash if scientific libraries like NumPy or Scikit-image were not installed.
**Solution**: Replaced the contents of `utils/analysis_utils.py` with a robust implementation that includes pure Python fallbacks for all key statistical and analysis functions.
**Impact**: The application can now run in a minimal environment without crashing, gracefully degrading functionality.

### 3. Standardized ChimeraX Path Detection (MAJOR)
**Problem**: ChimeraX integration was unreliable due to inconsistent path detection and poor use of the configuration file.
**Solution**: Updated the `ChimeraXIntegration` class to prioritize the path from `config/config.json`, then use the robust auto-detection logic, and finally use a hardcoded fallback.
**Impact**: More reliable and predictable integration with ChimeraX across different user setups.

### 4. Renamed Misleading Class Names (MINOR)
**Problem**: Classes like `CellposeSegmentation` implied the use of AI models but used classical algorithms.
**Solution**: Renamed to `GradientWatershedSegmentation` with clear documentation to accurately represent its capabilities.
**Impact**: Code is now less misleading and more maintainable.

## Verification Steps

### Test Phase Correlation
```python
from src.timelapse_processor import ImageAligner
# The align_timelapse_sequence method with 'phase_correlation' now uses the correct FFT-based logic.
```

### Test Dependency Fallbacks
```bash
# Run the application in a Python environment without numpy/scipy installed.
# The analysis tools should still function using the pure Python fallbacks.
```

### Test ChimeraX Integration
```bash
# Set a custom path in config/config.json.
# The application should prioritize this path.
```
